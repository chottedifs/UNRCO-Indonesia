                        On October 29, 2021, the day COP26 kicked off in Glasgow, Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo issued a Presidential Regulation setting out the country’s framework for action on climate change and stipulating policies for the preparation of mitigation activities to reduce carbon emissions. <br><br>
                        ​​The declining rate of deforestation in Indonesia serves as proof of the success of the government’s recent forest management    initiatives, including    a    2019 moratorium   that   tightened   the   implementation   of laws on illegal logging and other damaging activities. As a result, Indonesia’s annual deforestation rate has fallen for four consecutive years, to 119,100 hectares in 2020. The country is now on track to meet one requirement of the Nationally Determined Contributions which targets a 29% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  Through the UN’s KALFOR Project, the UN is helping to conserve an additional 44,490 Ha of land through non-forest area protection governance, which entails the mitigation of 16,138,427.17 tons of CO2e emissions. <br><br>
                        The   Ministry   of   Environment   and   Forestry (MoEF) and   the   UN   have   also   been   working together to advance the haze-free and sustainable peatland management agenda in Indonesia for over a decade—in part funded by the Global Environment Fund (GEF).  Another UN–MoEF    peatland-focused    partnership   facilitated the installation of two peatland hydrology units that cover about 5% of Indonesia’s total peatland in 2021. The hydrology units are responsible for saving almost 20 million tCO2e of greenhouse gas emissions. Their capacity to make water available for agriculture and render peatland less vulnerable to degradation and fires benefitted 7,326 people directly and a further 22,000 indirectly. <br><br>

                        The blistering pace of economic development over the past decade has lifted millions of people out of poverty in Indonesia, but it has also increased demand for energy. Today, some 30 million people lack adequate access to electricity.  If Indonesia is to deliver on phasing out coal-fired power stations, it urgently needs more clean energy and more efficient ways to make use of its generation mix. <br><br>
                        A UN project called ADLIGHT is helping Indonesia transition to more energy-efficient lighting technologies, a process that could end up saving up to 250,000 tons of CO2 eq in greenhouse gas emissions. Another    project    that    focuses    on    transforming Indonesia’s energy sector, called MTRE3, contributed to more than half a million people living in rural areas being able to access electricity generated from renewable energy sources by the end of 2021. <br><br>
                        Situated along the Pacific Rim of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. In 2021, some 3,034 disasters impacted 8.3 million people, according to Indonesia’s National Disaster Mitigation Agency.  Like COVID-19, disasters set back the 2030 Agenda and exacerbate pre-existing inequalities. <br><br>
                        UN interventions throughout 2021 enhanced cross-sector coordination between government and local civil society organizations to prepare for and respond to disasters.  That included the establishment of new provincial logistic clusters in Central Java and South Sulawesi. The UN also implemented disaster risk reduction strategies for six villages, that centre on 12 tsunami-ready indicators and ran capacity building seminars for 1,303 health practitioners and government officials on how to ensure the availability of contraceptives during crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>

                        The speed at which COVID-19’s Delta variant tore through Indonesia in summer 2021 and the emergence of the Omicron variant in December underscores the need for continued vigilance to halt the spread of the pandemic.  But scientists are clear COVID-19 will not be the last   pandemic   the   world   faces—and   governments must build on the lessons of 2020 to ensure they are prepared for the next outbreak. In 2021, the UN collaborated with the Ministry of Health in 2021 on the development of a training module to strengthen public   health   emergency   preparedness   capacities at hospitals and community health centres, and to mitigate the risk of the emergence or re-emergence of   high-threat   pathogens.  This   included   extensive support of the Ministry of Health’s contact tracing capacity, including on-the-job training for staff across 19 provinces on the use of a digital tracing application that resulted in 35,000 people being registered as contact tracers. The UN also supported the establishment of a zoonosis information system for the Ministry of Health, covering priority zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza, leptospirosis, rabies, anthrax, and Nipah virus. <br><br>
                        Rapid industrial development and population growth have put Indonesia’s incredible biodiversity at risk, but the UN is working with the Government to ensure that raising living standards for Indonesia’s human population does not come at the expense of the more than 300,000 wildlife species that also call the archipelago home. <br><br>
                        A UN project to combat the illegal trade in endangered species led to the development of Indonesia’s first-ever national strategy to combat illegal wildlife trafficking in 2021, which is now awaiting legalization. In     2021, Indonesia     successfully     initiated     the implementation   of   four   new UNESCO-designated sites—all based on the principles of integrated land and   seascape   planning. <br><br>

                <span class="text-submodal-story">Out of Work Garment Factory Workers Learn New Skills During COVID-19</span><br><br>
                When the factory she worked at halted operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Eni was one of the hundreds of garment workers in sukabumi Regency, West Java to lose a economic lifeline. "The Pandemic has been
                challenging for me." she says. "I lost my job, but i still have to pay for my mother's medical treatments." <br><br>
                As an industry whose workforce is 80% female, the plight of indonesia's garment factory workers is just one example of the disproportionate impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on women and girls. In response,
                UN women teamed up with Jakarta-based NGO Yayasan Care Peduli to launch a gender-responsive cash-for-work programme, targeted at Sukabumi's struggling garment workers. For three months from January 2021,
                the programme provided about 1.2 million Indonesian Rupiah each for 610 acutely vulnerable women, while they received training in cloth mask production and entrepreneurship skills. it also engaged the women's
                male partners in training to promote more equitable relationship within households. <br><br>
                "The cash for-work programme has opened an opportunity for me to generate new  income" Eni said. Another participant, Icoh said that as well as teaching her new skills, the scheme had connected her with a support
                network of women facing similiar challenges. "The income the i receive will be used to cover my daily needs and some of it will be put away for savings." she said. "I plan to join a coorporative and hope to start
                my own sewing business someday."

                <span class="text-submodal-story">Indonesian Dai'yahs Help Protect Girls from Gender-Based Violence</span><br><br>
                As a teacher at an Islamic junior high school, 45-year-old Nia Qolbunia is responsible for the welfare of the hundreds of female students under her care in West Java. But the scope and impact of her work expands beyond religious teaching. Women religious leaders known as Dai’yah also serve as trusted pre-marriage counselors, family planning advisors, and in many cases champions of women’s sexual and reproductive rights. <br><br>
                Nia is one of many Dai’yah to join a training programme co-organized by UNFPA and two Muslim organizations in Indonesia designed to bolster their skills in caring for women and girls during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through 2020 and 2021, restrictions on movement curtailed women’s access to sexual and reproductive health services and exposed them to higher risks of gender-based violence, unintended pregnancies, and harmful practices like female genital mutilation and child marriage. “A lot of husbands stay at or work from home. As a result, there have been a lot of unplanned pregnancies,” Nia says. “Many parents have also married off their teenage children. There is online gender-based violence and domestic violence too.” <br><br>
                Nia’s activities at the school now include instruction on the importance of family planning and encouraging girls to postpone marriage until they are at least 21 years old. Her school assists in the provision of contraceptive services, in collaboration with the Government, to ensure young women’s ability to continue their education or pursue employment opportunities are not compromised. “I want to fight for the rights of women and children, especially in reproductive health and education for women, to make gender equality a reality in the family and the society,” she says. <br>

                <span class="text-submodal-story">A Papuan Influencer challenges Stigma Around Menstruation</span><br><br>
                Jeni Karay, a popular Papuan social media influencer, still remembers how cultural taboos made it impossible for her to seek support when she first got her period in junior high school. “I couldn’t talk about it with my parents. I felt menstruation was a shameful thing to talk about, even with my friends and family,” she recalls. <br><br>
                It is an all-too common situation. A 2017 Health and Demographic Survey found that one-in-five girls never talk about the topic of menstruation before they get their first period. This rate is higher in rural areas, including in eastern parts of Indonesia like Papua. In a UNICEF U-Report poll of over 5,800 female respondents between April and May 2020, one in six girls and women said they experienced some difficulty handling their menstruation during the pandemic. <br><br>
                That is why UNICEF developed Oky, a period tracker application for mobile phones that allows adolescent girls to track how their period affects their body and mood so they can better understand their own body and stay healthy and happy. <br><br>
                Impressed with Oky, Jeni began to promote it to her followers on social media and encouraged young people in Papua, including boys, to download the app. “Having Oky in the hands of Papuan girls will give them access to a trustworthy source of information on menstruation,” she said. “Giving trustworthy information to Papuan girls is part of my personal mission to empower them.” <br>

                Community activist Hasanah was already leading women’s economic empowerment training courses under the UN Women-supported “Peace Village” initiative when election season came around in Guluk-Guluk village. Located on Indonesia’s Madura Island, Guluk-Guluk has developed a reputation for conflict erupting around local politics, and Hasanah knew the upcoming ballot could be a flashpoint. <br><br>
                Drawing on skills she had learned as a community trainer, Hasanah mobilized her Peace Village Working Group to de-escalate the rising tensions in the run-up to the election. Her group—60% of whom are women—convened several discussions between competing candidates and their supporters. Those meetings eventually led to all parties signing an agreement promising to adhere to peaceful behavior during the election. They kept their promise: Guluk-Guluk’s ballot proceeded peacefully—and all parties accepted its result without dispute. <br><br>
                Through participating in the Peace Village programme, Hasanah says, “I learned how to better resolve conflict and how to focus on building peace and harmony between people in my community.” <br>
