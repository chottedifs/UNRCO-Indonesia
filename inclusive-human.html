                    The convergence of Indonesia’s high informal labour rate, its geographically diffuse population, 
                    and the unequal socio-economic burdens imposed by COVID-19 heightened the risk of people falling 
                    through the social safety net in 2021. <br> <br>
                    Universal health coverage is key to shoring up that net 
                    and the UN has supported the expansion of Indonesia’s national health insurance program since its 
                    rollout in 2014. By 2021 the insurance scheme covered 86.96% of the population, up from 82.07% in 
                    2020. The UN helped more than 3.3 million children receive unconditional child benefits in 2021, 
                    while 35.9 million people indirectly benefit from UN support to strengthen social protection programmes.

                    <p class="lead-content-2-2">
                        Food supply chain disruptions and the loss of income during COVID-19 contributed to an increase
                        in undernourishment in Indonesia, which afflicted 8.34% of the population in 2020, 
                        up from 7.63% in 2019, according to Indonesia’s 2021 Voluntary National Review. 
                        Among other initiatives, the UN provided technical assistance to the Ministry of 
                        Agriculture that resulted in the finalisation of one national and five provincial 
                        Food Security and Vulnerability Atlases, which informed several country-wide programmes to 
                        tackle food insecurity and reduce childhood stunting. Meanwhile, almost 5,000 health service 
                        providers received UN training on the integrated management of acute malnutrition. <br> <br> 
                        The COVID-19 pandemic pushed Indonesia’s healthcare system to the brink in 2021, 
                        which not only taxed the country’s ability to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus but 
                        also its ability to cope with an array of contemporary health challenges. UN interventions 
                        helped the system continue to function under unprecedented stress. 
                        The World Health Organization alone supported 39 activities to strengthen Indonesia’s 
                        healthcare capacity, across technology, policy, and human resources. For example, the 
                        UN trained more than 183,000 health workers on surveillance, rapid response, and psychosocial 
                        support in relation to the detection, referral and management of COVID-19 cases. 
                        UN training helped a further 4,312 health workers enhance their knowledge of pharmacology 
                        and pharmacovigilance in relation to COVID-19 preparedness and response efforts; more than 
                        10,000 primary care workers received extra training on HIV testing and treatment.

                        Despite considerable progress over the past decade, Indonesia’s maternal mortality ratio remains high 
                        with some 177 deaths occurring for every 100,000 live births, compared with a regional average of 152 
                        per 100,000 live births. <br> <br> In 2021, UN support for Government efforts to deliver better   maternal   and  
                        new-born   health included the provision of technical assistance for new guidelines on maternal and 
                        perinatal death surveillance, and specific assistance to improve the care of vulnerable infants, including 
                        infants with low birth weight, those with possible serious bacterial infections, and those born to 
                        HIV-positive mothers. UN support to strengthen maternal health services benefitted more than 5.7 million 
                        people. <br><br> A further 232,000 people directly benefited from Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) interventions 
                        as part of the UN’s COVID-19 prevention and response efforts. Meanwhile, a UN pilot water safety programme 
                        provided more than 1 million people with improved access to clean water, while UN initiatives to promote 
                        open-defecation free villages reduced disease risk for some 100,000 people in rural areas.

                    <p class="lead-content-2">
                        The COVID-19 pandemic caused the world’s largest-ever recorded disruption in education. 
                        To mitigate this disruption, in 2021 the UN helped approximately 5.7 million Indonesian 
                        students at over 37,000 schools safely resume face-to-face learning in accordance with 
                        COVID-19 health protocols. UN support for child-centred planning and budgeting helped 
                        ensure the continuity of education for 400 out-of-school children, and almost 1,500 
                        children at risk of dropping out of school. The UN also supported more than 45,600 students, 
                        including 2887 children of refugees and asylum seekers with equipment to facilitate 
                        home-based learning. <br><br> In Indonesia, like in other countries, violent extremist groups   
                        sought to capitalise on pandemic-induced social isolation and economic adversity to spread 
                        divisive narratives and disinformation. This required an evolving and inclusive human 
                        security-based strategy on the prevention of violent extremism (PVE.) <br><br> Since 2017, the 
                        UN has worked closely with the Wahid Foundation to empower   women   to   build   
                        peaceful and   resilient   communities   and   support   a   gender-responsive approach 
                        to conflict prevention and PVE through its Peace Villages project.  Some 17 villages, 
                        covering a   population   of   about   100,000   people, declared themselves ‘Peace Villages’ 
                        between 2017 and 2021, meaning that village stakeholders have committed to achieving   
                        nine   indicators   of   a   peaceful   village with women’s participation and leadership.  
                        In 2021, more than 100 Peace Village residents joined training programs—since converted to 
                        e-learning tools—that focus on preventing violent extremism, implementing gender   equality,
                        and   increasing   access   to   justice. The UN and Wahid Foundation’s Peace Village action 
                        plan draws support from the Ministry of Villages, provincial and local governments, 
                        and stakeholders including village heads, local religious leaders, and faith-based organisations.

                        The UN also supports Indonesia’s National Action Plan on PVE through The Guyub Project—which 
                        means “togetherness” in Javanese—and several other programmes that operate out of The Peace Hub, 
                        a unique physical an online platform that brings together UN agencies, government, national 
                        security agencies and civil society on counterterrorism and PVE. <br><br> 
                        The affiliated programmes, Guyub, Convey, and Protect, reached more than 13 million people to 
                        promote human security-based approaches to PVE. In late 2020, Indonesia became one of 16 country 
                        champions of the UN’s Global Compact on Migration (GCM).  In accordance with the GCM’s values, the UN continued   
                        to   advance   a   whole-of-government and   whole-of-society   approach   to   migration   
                        in 2021, promoting   policies   that   support   Indonesia’s commitment to protecting the 
                        rights of migrants. <br><br> 
                        Through its Safe and Fair Migration Joint Programme (SAF), for example, 
                        the UN collaborated with five women crisis centres to support victims of violence against women 
                        and trafficking, including women migrant workers and their families.  The programme mobilised 
                        community-level stakeholders to prevent and   respond   to   violence   against   women   
                        through improved case monitoring, caseworker    training, referrals, and    information sharing.
                        Through    this intervention, some 5,000 migrant workers and them families—including    about    
                        3,000    women—received training and information on recruitment agencies, labour rights, 
                        women’s rights, safe migration procedures, and financial literacy. A further 292 migrant 
                        workers who had been victims of violence received psychosocial support and referrals to essential 
                        services. <br><br>

                        and asylum seekers. UN advocacy also helped make it easier for refugees to access COVID-19 vaccinations.
